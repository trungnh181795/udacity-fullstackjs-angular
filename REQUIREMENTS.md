# Project features

Your application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
